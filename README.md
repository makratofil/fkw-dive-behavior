# False Killer Whale Diving Behavior Analysis
This repository contains the code for processing, analyzing, and visualizing data presented in *Ecological and social contexts of diving behavior reveal foraging flexibility in Hawaiian false killer whales* Kratofil MA, Shaff JF, Hoffbauer HK, Cantor M, Hill MC, Baird RW. (in prep; to be submitted to *Movement Ecology*). Raw location and behavior data are being used for several current analyses and thus are not publicly available at this time. However, location data can be visualized on [Movebank](https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-main) and made available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

## Data processing
This folder contains R scripts and helper functions for reviewing (QA/QC) and processing dive and location data for further analyses. The movement data processing (i.e., raw Argos/GPS location data filtering) is not provided here; see [Kratofil et al. (2023)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1053581/full) for details on these methods. Seafloor depth and oceanographic files are not provided due to space limitations, but can be found at the links provided in the manuscript. 

## Analyses
This folder contains R scripts for completing the analyses (e.g., summary statistics, multivariate models) reported in the manuscript. 

## Visualizations
This folder contains R scripts and helper functions for creating the figures that are presented in the manuscript and additional files. Note that for several multi-paneled figures, individual plots were saved in the R scripts and panels were subsequently arranged in Adobe Illustrator.
